                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Julie is a front-end developer with experience 
                    in front-end and back-end development. 
                    She is a current student in the Udacity front-end 
                    nanodegree interested in finding an entry level 
                    position as a web or UI developer. She has worked 
                    in Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, ES6, jQuery, MERN 
                    stack, Sass and Python.</p>

                <p>Her projects at the moment are as follows, the 
                    first one is a random sentence generator based 
                    on a corpus gathered from the short stories of 
                    Sherlock Holmes. </p>

                <p>Julie's greatest interests from the moment she 
                    inquired into web development are focused on 
                    semantic application of design and proper layout 
                    of websites. In her free time she designs code 
                    snippets to test her CSS abilities and expand them. </p>

                    <p>Previous to becoming a student of Udacity, she 
                    graduated in a BS Electronics Engineering where 
                    she discovered her true passion for programming 
                    by building an autonomous robot and programming 
                    it as well as programming a robotic arm for her 
                    thesis.</p>
