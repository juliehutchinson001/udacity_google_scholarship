<!-- 
    Make a Button
For this quiz, all I want you to do is type out the HTML 
to create a button element.

A BUTTON
Buttons may look different based on browser and operating 
system.

The purpose of this quiz is to make sure that you're 
using the correct syntax. As you will realize when you 
build websites, you can write HTML incorrectly — by 
forgetting a closing tag, for example — and the browser 
will try to correct your mistake. Sometimes the browser 
will guess correctly and your website will look fine. 
But most of the time, it will be wrong and strange bugs 
will start appearing.

This is a good time to double check that you're creating 
elements correctly because you'll be writing more 
complicated HTML soon!
