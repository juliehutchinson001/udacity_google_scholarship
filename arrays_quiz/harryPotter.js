/*
 * Programming Quiz: Quidditch Cup (6-5)
 * 
 * In the Harry Potter novels, children attending the Hogwarts 
 * School of Witchcraft and Wizardry belong to one of four houses: 
 * Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Each year, the 
 * houses assemble a Quidditch team of seven players to compete for 
 * the coveted Quidditch Cup.
 * 
 * Consider the following array.
 * 
 * var team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", 
 *             "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", 
 *             "Harry Potter"];
 * 
 * Directions:
 * Create a function called hasEnoughPlayers() that takes the team 
 * array as an argument and returns true or false depending on if 
 * the array has at least seven players.
 *
